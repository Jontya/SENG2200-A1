### Problem Statement

Parse and store each polygon specification. A polygon will be specified in the input by 
the letter P, followed by the  number of sides the polygon has, and then pairs of numbers which 
represent the respective vertices on the Cartesian plane (x-value then y-value).
You do not have to worry about any of the data being missing, or out of order.
